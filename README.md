# Personal Portfolio of David Robert

This is a personal portfolio website for David Robert, Data Scientist & ML Engineer, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The site is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to update.

## Look & Feel
-   **Style**: Minimalist, modern, and clean with plenty of whitespace.
-   **Palette**: Neutral colors (white/grey) with a soft green accent.
-   **Typography**: "Inter" from Google Fonts.
-   **Performance**: Optimized for high Lighthouse scores.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need to have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed on your machine. You can verify your installation by running:
```bash
hugo version
```

### Running Locally
To run the website on your local machine for development, use the following command. The `-D` flag ensures that content marked as `draft` is also rendered.

```bash
hugo server -D
```
The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313/`. Hugo will watch for changes and automatically reload the page.

### Building the Site
To generate the static site into the `public/` directory, run:
```bash
hugo
```
The contents of the `public/` folder are what you will deploy to your hosting service.

## How to Update Content

One of the key requirements of this project is the ease of content management. Most updates are done by editing YAML or Markdown files.

### 1. Editing Personal Information & CV
All your structured data (experience, skills, education, etc.) is located in a single file: `data/cv.yaml`.

-   **To add a new job**: Add a new item to the `experience` list.
-   **To add a new skill**: Find the relevant `category` under `skills` and add your new skill to the `items` list.
-   **To update your bio/tagline**: Edit the main configuration file `hugo.toml` under the `[params]` and `[params.hero]` sections.

### 2. Adding a New Project
Projects are managed as individual Markdown files inside the `content/projects/` directory.

To add a new project:
1.  Create a new file, for example `content/projects/my-new-project.md`.
2.  Start the file with the required "front matter" (the metadata between `---`). Use the following template:

```markdown
---
title: "My Awesome New Project"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "A short and compelling description of what this project is about."
tech: ["Python", "PyTorch", "FastAPI"]
featured: true # Set to 'true' to feature on the homepage, 'false' otherwise
links:
  demo: "https://link-to-your-project-demo.com" # Optional
  github: "https://github.com/your-username/your-repo" # Optional
---

Here you can write a longer description of your project using Markdown. You can add paragraphs, lists, links, etc. This content will appear on the project's dedicated page.
```

### 3. Adding a New Blog Post
The process is identical to adding a project, but you'll work in the `content/blog/` directory.

1.  Create a file like `content/blog/my-new-post.md`.
2.  Use the following front matter template:
```markdown
---
title: "Title of My New Blog Post"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "A brief summary of the blog post."
tags: ["AI", "LLMs", "Tutorial"]
---

Start writing your blog post content here in Markdown.
```

---

## Deployment

You can deploy the static site generated by Hugo to any static hosting provider. Here are two popular options:

### GitHub Pages
1.  Push your repository to GitHub.
2.  Configure a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy your site automatically. Hugo provides an official [workflow template](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github-pages/#build-hugo-with-github-action).
3.  The action will run `hugo` and push the contents of the `public/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch, which then serves your site.

### Netlify
1.  Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
2.  Configure the build settings:
    -   **Build command**: `hugo`
    -   **Publish directory**: `public`
3.  Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to your main branch.
